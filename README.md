# Introduction to DDP

The Distributed Data Protocol (DDP) is Meteor's real-time wire protocol based on
simple JSON messages. First you'll learn how a stateful protocol like DDP
differs from HTTP.  Then you'll get a detailed look at the DDP server using the
node-inspector server side debugging tool. Finally we'll create connected sessions
using a command line tool and a browser to learn about DDP sessions.
